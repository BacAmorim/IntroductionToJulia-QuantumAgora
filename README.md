# IntroductionToJulia-QuantumAgora
Materials for "Introduction to the Julia programming language" talk at the Quantum Agora meetings, organized by the [Quantum.Matter@PT network](https://quantummatterpt.weebly.com). 

**Title**: *Introduction to the Julia programming language*
**Abstract**:
Julia is a new high performance programming language aimed at scientific/technical computing. When it comes to programming languages one is faced with a dilemma: use a high level language that is easy to write code in, but slow (e.g. python); or use a fast language, but that is hard to write code in (e.g. C, C++, Fortran). Julia aims to solve this problem by providing high performance (comparable to C), combined with interactivity and a pleasant syntax. In this talk, I will give a brief description of the origins of the language, how it is capable of combining performance with ease of use and some projects that currently use it. Then we will have a short hands-on session covering the basics of programming in Julia.
